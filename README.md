## Roadmap

- state persistence
- trigger on privmsg events other than !command or <name>, command
- proper command line parsing and configurable name/channel/network info
- proper logging
- remember per-user aliases
- remember per-user spoilers
- !set [k v & kvs] to set info
- !alias [name] to mark current nick as an alias
- !info [name] and 'Sharky, tell me about [name]' to get user info
- !spoilers to get current spoiler level
