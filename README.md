# sharkybot2

A simple IRC bot for #gbchat, the Gentleman Bastards fan channel. Remembers pronouns and spoiler levels and eats people.

## Installation

Download the jar from the releases page, or download the source and `lein run` or `lein uberjar`.

## Usage

`lein run`. Connects and joins automatically, but this can be customized on the command line. See `lein run --help` for details.

## Roadmap

- trigger on privmsg events other than !command or <name>, command
- proper logging
- remember per-user aliases
- !alias [name] to mark current nick as an alias
- !spoilers to get current spoiler level
